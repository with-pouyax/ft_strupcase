# ft_strupcase

The `ft_strupcase` function is a straightforward utility for transforming any lowercase letters within a string to uppercase. It operates by iterating through each character of a given string, converting lowercase letters to their uppercase equivalents, thus ensuring the entire string is presented in uppercase form.

## Description

`ft_strupcase` takes a single argument: a pointer to a character string. As it traverses the string, it checks for lowercase alphabetic characters (`'a'` to `'z'`) and converts them to uppercase (`'A'` to `'Z'`) by adjusting their ASCII values. This function is especially useful for text processing applications where uniform case formatting is desired.
